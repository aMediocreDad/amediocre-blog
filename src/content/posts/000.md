## From a workshop by my friend Elisabeth Irgens at Booster Conf.

- Why did you join this workshop?
I want to improve my ability to put my thoughts into writing. I have a need for organising my thoughts, and pruning the incessant train of thoughts, ideas, and learning that has me give off the impression of someone who's not entirely there.
- Have you had a blog before? What happened?
I have had several attempts at a blog or creative writing outlets. I had to give up. Not because I wanted to, but because I find it difficult to follow through with anything that is remotely tedious. I wish I did not find writing... tedious.
- What do you hope this blog contains in 3 hours? 3 weeks? 3 years?
In 3 hours: my first attempts at doing this, again, in a long time; in 3 weeks: Stuff I care about; in 3 years: Memories.
