## TTRPGs

I have been playing tabletop roleplaying games (ttrpgs) from a young age. My first books were the Norwegian translations of the original D&D Basic & Expert books, also known as the Red and Blue books. The concept of roleplaying—that is, the game of roleplay, and not the act of improvising a role—was introduced to me by a temporary assistant teacher whom I remember fondly.

Ttrpgs are very giving, and a great exercise in empathy, self-insight, and communication, as well as teaching should you find yourself being the one who learns rules and teaches them to the rest of the table.

Most people whom I talk to have this preconceived notion of roleplaying games being nerdy, or weird, or awkward. In truth, many people engage in roleplaying daily albeit in tiny bursts as part of a conversation, or teaching moment.

Sitting down for a two-hour session of pure roleplay may therefore seem daunting and like a heavier commitment. But truly, it's a bit like talking to a therapist: You don't realize how valuable a tool like this is, before you actually sit down and try it out.

I don't think I can truly recommend enough that you, your friend, colleague—everyone—try playing a roleplaying game.
