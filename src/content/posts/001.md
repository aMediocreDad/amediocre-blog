## Caring

Writing isn't just about putting ideas or knowledge on a page, or about solidifying those things. It's about showing that you care.

Writing comes from a place of caring, of wanting to share or to remember. Especially, writing that is not prompted from some external incentive.

By conjuring up letters on a page, you show that this is something _I_ care about; something _I_ want to give life toâ€”however brief.

In the end you can always remove it from existence if you stop caring. Though, perhaps someone out there already adopted it before you do.
